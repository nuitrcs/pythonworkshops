# Statistics and Machine Learning Models

## Downloading Files

### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the notebook and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

### Entire directory

You can download all of the files from just this directory as a .zip file from [this link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops/tree/master/dataanalysis/models).

### Downloading Exercises

To download just the exercise files, right-click on the links below, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser).  On a Mac, to open the files in Jupyter Notebook, start Jupyter Notebook from the folder where you saved the files (or one above it).  On Windows, navigate to the directory within Jupyter Notebook.

## Resources

[Introduction to Statistics with Python](https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python): link is to a GitHub repository for materials to accompany a book by the same name by Thomas Haslwanter.  Examples focus on the life sciences.  The book is available online through the [Northwestern library](http://search.library.northwestern.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlSearch.do?field=title&query=title%2Ccontains%2CIntroduction+to+Statistics+with+Python&operation=1&institution=01NWU&vid=NULV&search_scope=NWU&tab=default_tab&indx=1&bulkSize=10&dym=true&highlight=true&displayField=title) (login required).

[`statsmodels` Examples](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels) are in the project's GitHub repository, in addition to in the documentation

[Model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html): this is the first in a three part series of good explanations/tutorials for those looking to better understand how to navigate options in machine learning; written by Sebastian Raschka, a computational biologist (but the material is for a general audience)
