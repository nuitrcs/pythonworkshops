This list has resources that may be useful across workshops.  There may be additional resources listed with each workshop.


## Tutorials and Books

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com): online interactive tutorials.  The intro course is available for free, but other courses require a subscription.  Research Computing is currently providing access for Northwestern researchers.  [Apply for access](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html).

[Exploratory Computing with Python](http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/): notebooks and videos covering common tasks researchers might want to do with Python for exploring data.  Intro Python topics are covered alongside data analysis and plotting examples.

[UC Boulder Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Meetup-Fall-2013): workshop materials from some of our research computing colleagues at UC Boulder.  Includes exercises.

[A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): just what it says, in a notebook.  From Rick Muller at Sandia National Labs.

[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): the official Python tutorial.  Think of it more as reference material with lots of examples.  Particularly useful for those who know other programming languages and want to see how to do something in Python.  It teaches Python, not programming.

[Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com): introduction to Python focused on tasks (and using examples) that are relevant to many biologists

[Useful and Interesting Notebooks](http://nb.bianp.net/sort/views/): collection of useful and/or interesting Jupyter notebooks spanning a range of topics

## Reference Materials

[Python Basics Cheat Sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PythonForDataScience.pdf): one page pdf with reminders of basic string, list, and Numpy array operations

[Chris Albon's Blog](https://chrisalbon.com/#Blog): not limited to Python, but does include an extensive set of examples of common Python operations.  Also lots of notes on data science and machine learning topics.

[Python Standard Library Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html): what all of the built-in libraries do and how to use them.

[Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/index.html#reference-index): documentation of core Python syntax.
