## Tutorials and Books

[Exploratory Computing with Python](http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/): notebooks and videos covering common tasks researchers might want to do with Python for exploring data.  Intro Python topics are covered alongside data analysis and plotting examples.

[A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): just what it says, in a notebook.  From Rick Muller at Sandia National Labs.

[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): the official Python tutorial.  Think of it more as reference material with lots of examples.  Particularly useful for those who know other programming languages and want to see how to do something in Python.  It teaches Python, not programming.

[Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com): introduction to Python focused on tasks (and using examples) that are relevant to many biologists

## Exercises

[Python Exercises with Solutions](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/): lots of traditional programming exercises with solutions
